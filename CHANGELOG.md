# @atlaskit/tree

## 8.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [`cb2392f6d33`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/cb2392f6d33) - Upgrade to TypeScript 4.2.4

## 8.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`7becb9517f5`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7becb9517f5) - Fixed bug where drag and drop is broken in the case where only some tree items are draggable (i.e. passing a function to the isDragEnabled prop)

## 8.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1fb6e5f07eb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1fb6e5f07eb) - Performance optimization which prevents Draggables from being rendered if drag and drop is disabled

## 8.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`996a944785e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/996a944785e) - [ux] nondraggable and draggable tree items will both re-render every time the tree renders. This allows draggable/nondraggable items to behave the same.

## 8.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`7d9095756b7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7d9095756b7) - [ux] nondraggable and draggable tree items will both re-render every time the tree renders. This allows draggable/nondraggable items to behave the same.

## 8.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`955641ffdc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/955641ffdc) - Add the ability to specify `isDragEnabled` as a function. This will allow to control whether the item is draggable or not on a per-item basis.

## 8.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`d3265f19be`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d3265f19be) - Transpile packages using babel rather than tsc

## 8.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`5f58283e1f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/5f58283e1f) - Export types using Typescript's new "export type" syntax to satisfy Typescript's --isolatedModules compiler option.
  This requires version 3.8 of Typescript, read more about how we handle Typescript versions here: https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/get-started
  Also add `typescript` to `devDependencies` to denote version that the package was built with.

## 8.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`6c525a8229`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6c525a8229) - Upgraded to TypeScript 3.9.6 and tslib to 2.0.0

  Since tslib is a dependency for all our packages we recommend that products also follow this tslib upgrade
  to prevent duplicates of tslib being bundled.

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
